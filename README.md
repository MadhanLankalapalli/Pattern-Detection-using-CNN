# Pattern-Detection-using-CNN
This project implements a pattern detection system capable of identifying and counting specific patterns within an image using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework. By applying Laplacian filters and CNN techniques such as convolutional layers and max pooling, the system detects the occurrence of a test pattern in a 128x128 input image.
